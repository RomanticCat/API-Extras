{"name":"API-Extras","tagline":"Extensions for core DSpace","body":"# Extensions for core DSpace\r\n\r\nThis repository contains extension code for [DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace).\r\n\r\n# How to use this\r\n\r\nThere are two steps to using API-Extras in your DSpace repository.\r\n\r\n## Obtain, build and install the code\r\n\r\nFirst, you will need to download, build and install the maven module on the computer where you're intending to build DSpace. Take care to download a version of API-Extras that is compatible with your DSpace version (look at the version of the dspace-api dependency in this project's pom.xml file). You will typically want to check out one of the tags (released versions) of API-Extras rather than just master. At the top level of this project's source tree, run `mvn package install`. This will place the api-extras-VERSION.jar file in your local maven cache.\r\n\r\n## Pull API-Extras into DSpace\r\n\r\nThen you will need to pull the API-Extras module into DSpace. In your DSpace source tree, edit the `dspace/modules/additions/pom.xml` file. At the top of the existing dependencies section, you will need to insert a new dependency block. \r\n````\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>nz.ac.waikato.its</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>api-extras</artifactId>\r\n            <version>VERSION</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n````\r\nInstead of VERSION, put in the version of API-Extras you built in the first step. Make any other changes to actually use the features in API-Extras (eg, add curation task configuration to `dspace/config/modules/curate.cfg`). Finally, rebuild DSpace.","google":"UA-62467742-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
